Then wait for the fall, if love is really great
What's wrong with me, am I worse than others?
Who wants to stay home and popcorn on the TV on weekends?
I cried when I saw what you said

Ten men, seven stupid, nine bad
And one loves the sisters to jump out
Cute sweet words tricked him
Love well, don't let him go
Ten men, seven stupid, nine bad
And one loves the sisters to jump out
Cute sweet words tricked him
Love well, don't let him go

Find someone to fall in love with, I won't let you tell you
Like a withered rose, the rain in my heart is desperately falling
Don't be afraid of my sun from now on
If you love each other, you will grow up and accept her alone

Ten men, seven stupid, nine bad
And one loves the sisters to jump out
Cute sweet words tricked him
Love well, don't let him go
Ten men, seven stupid, nine bad
And one loves the sisters to jump out
Cute sweet words tricked him
Love well, don't let him go

Ten men, seven stupid, nine bad
And one loves the sisters to jump out
Cute sweet words tricked him
Love well, don't let him go
Ten men, seven stupid, nine bad
And one loves the sisters to jump out
Cute sweet words tricked him
Love well, don't let him go

Lie him over and love him and don't let him go
Lie him over and love him and don't let him go
Love well, don't let him go
